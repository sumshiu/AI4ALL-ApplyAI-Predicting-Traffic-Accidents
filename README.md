# APPLY AI Car Accident Prediction Model

*Analyzed and predicted sources of bias and the probability of car accidents happening, employing advanced Python techniques and data analysis methodologies, all within AI4ALL's cutting-edge Apply AI program.*



## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

*Traffic accidents occur from humansâ€™ actions and physical state, such as being distracted, under the influence, fatigue, etc. Traffic accidents cause fatalities and injuries every year. By reducing its likelihood of happening, many lives can be saved. Traffic accidents lead to significant economic losses, from property damage to medical expenses. Productivity loss also occurs during the healing process. As the human population continues to boom, cities will inevitably expand and become increasingly congested. This will increase the risk of traffic accidents, but using AI to address the problem can enhance urban living. Reducing accidents leads to fewer traffic jams, fuel consumption, and emissions.*

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

1. *Analyzed over 7 million lines of data*
2. *Identified four biases in our dataset*
   - *Low driving confidence*
   - *Underreporting accidents*
   - *Population Density*
   - *Normal waking hours*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

   *To accomplish this, we utilized Google Colab and Kaggle, and we designed a custom Python script to predict the chances of an accident occurring with the dataset we chose. Predicted by using multiple variables with over 7 million entries of the dataset. We used exploratory data analysis to determine which variables impact and are most relevant to the accidents. We then decided to use a linear regression algorithm to predict how two variables will either correlate or cause the accident. We also used a linear regression algorithm to predict our model's accuracy.*
